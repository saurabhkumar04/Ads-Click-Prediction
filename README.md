        ”Click Here!”. Isn’t it fascinating how ad clicks can generate tons of revenue? To boost the income through 
        ad clicks, it is imperative to understand the significance of the factors affecting ad clicks. Outbrain, the web’s 
        leading content discovery platform, matches relevant content with users in about 250 billion personalized 
        recommendations each month across many thousands of sites. In this report we try to improve Outbrain’s algorithm
        to predict which pieces of content it’s global base of users are likely to click on. Based on the analysis of the
        huge dataset provided by Outbrain, our primary prediction model sorted ads according to their prior probabilities
        of being clicked. Our next approach included penalizing and awarding ads based on their click counts. Subsequently,
        we included ad attributes such as advertisers and campaigners, followed by ad display platform. In a nutshell,
        we did not use all the features due to our machines’ inability to handle huge-datasets. We incorporated few
        transformed features for our click prediction model which uses Naive Bayes and Stochastic Gradient Descent. The
        designed model predicts ad clicks with an accuracy of 80.98%.
